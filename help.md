This Rubik's Cube program is a simple and free open source python program for macos that uses the `twophase.solver` python library and allows you to solve your Rubik's Cube, get the scramble for a certain scrambled state or an algorithm for a certain pattern. To change the number of moves it takes to solve the puzzle or change the mode the program is in, edit the `settings.json` file. But, if you want to change the number of moves for the scramble/pattern, you have to edit the source code of this program. For help with making the string that represents the cube, watch (this)[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4BGnkI6Q0nfeWIFIXOb9IA?sub_confirmation=true] video.
